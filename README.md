## This is the official repository for fablabs.io platform project.

Fab labs provide widespread access to modern means for invention. They began as an outreach project from MITâ€™s Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA), and became into a collaborative and global network. You can find more information about Fab Labs on the [Fab Foundation Website](http://www.fabfoundation.org/).

If you are a Fab labs entusiast and/or you would like to contribute to the project please feel free to get in touch by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/fablabbcn/fablabs/issues/new).

## Getting started

The platform is built with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/). We recommend reading the [guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).

You can develop locally, or by using docker-compose (advanced).

1. Start by creating the config file and edit as needed
   - `cp .env.example .env`

### Local development (recommended)

We recommend using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to handle different Ruby versions, and [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to handle Node versions.

Install dependencies and create a database:

1. `npm i`

1. `bundle`

1. `rake db:setup`

1. `rails s`

1. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


#### Setup on MacOS

On MacOS to have the exact Ruby version, use a version manager. Default MacOS Ruby is incompatible. See example article [how to setup on mac](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/)

With `chruby` installed, you can do something like this:

1. `ruby-install 2.6.10`
1. `chruby 2.6.10`
1. `gem install bundler:2.3.26` (check Gemfile.lock file)
1. `bundler install` (optional: `bundle config set --local without 'test'`)
1. `nvm use` (setup NodeJS with )


**Trouble shooting**
Issue with bundle install and postgress
a. `brew install libpq` ()
a. `export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libpq/lib/pkgconfig"`



### Tests

Run tests with:

`bundle exec rake`


### Using docker-compose (optional, for advanced users)

1. Start the project:

   `docker-compose up app`

1. Create database (only the first time):

   `docker-compose exec app rake db:setup`

   OR 

   `docker-compose exec app rake db:schema:load`

   If npm does not successfully install do:

   `docker-compose exec app npm i`

1. Add this to your `/etc/hosts`:

   ```
   127.0.0.1   www.fablabs.local
   127.0.0.1   api.fablabs.local
   ```

1. Visit [http://www.fablabs.local:3000](http://www.fablabs.local:3000)

1. API is served on [http://api.fablabs.local:3000](http://api.fablabs.local:3000)

1. Add test users and data with

    `docker-compose exec app rake db:seed`

    This will create a normal user (email=user@user.local, password=password) and an admin user
    (email=admin@admin.local, password=password)

1. Run tests with

   `docker-compose exec app rake db:setup RAILS_ENV=test`

   `docker-compose exec app rake spec`

1. If you make changes to the code, rebuild the app and deploy the new image

   `docker-compose build`

   `docker-compose up -d`

1. Backup your db at any time with the included script:

    ```
    ./scripts/docker-backup-db.sh
    ```

1. Other:
   
   `docker compose exec app bundle update --patch`

1. Access Postgress database:

   `docker exec -it fablabsio_db_1 psql -d fablabs -U postgres`


## Getting an API Token

1. Login to fablabs.io
2. Go to the [developer console](https://fablabs.io/oauth/applications/) (on the upper-right menu)
3. Create a **New application**, or edit an existing one.
4. Fill in the form, Redirect URI can be 'https://example.com'
5. Submit

Copy the **Personal access token**

Verify the token is working with the following terminal command:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.fablabs.io/0/me' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_personal_token>'
```

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.fablabs.io/2/labs?page=0&per_page=100'  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_personal_token>'
```

## Production notes

If you are running in production:

- you need to setup the SSL hosts and .env vars from the docker-compose.yml

- you must define Amazon S3 env vars, all thumbnails and images depend on this:

```
S3_BUCKET=your_fablabs.io
S3_KEY=<amazon key>
S3_SECRET=<amazon secret>
S3_REGION=<amazon region code>
```

- you need to run the assets pipeline to update public/assets

`docker-compose exec app bundle exec rake tmp:clear`

`docker-compose exec app bundle exec rake assets:precompile`

`docker-compose restart app`

## Pull requests

All PRs are tested on Github Actions. Make sure the tests run.

## Languages and translation

The project is now on Crowdin https://crwd.in/fablabsio

Use the `i18n-tasks normalize` before submitting language changes

## Styleguide

There is a minimal styleguide on http://localhost:3000/styleguide

Use it and update it if you add new reusable classes

## Versioning

Currently using this tool to manually handle versioning: https://github.com/gregorym/bump

Use this command to update the VERSION file + create a git tag

`bump patch --tag`

Then push the git tag with:

`git push --tags`
